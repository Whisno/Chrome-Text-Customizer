## Performances

- Measure time taken by DOM operations

- Improve test case

- Automatically run tests on commits


## Functionalities

- Allow to select more specific options depending on the type of match / replacement and implement it with a pattern strategy or something like that. For instance, when replaceing a regexp by a string you might want to preserve case (if all lowercase, all uppercase our first letter uppercase).

- Add replacement function presets like "Wrap in tag" ?

- Seriously improve the options page
  - it should always be as straightforward as the use case being executed.
  - the code is ugly

- Go through iframes

- What to do with html entities ?

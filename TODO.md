## Performances

- Measure time taken by DOM operations and make text replacement as efficient as possible

- Improve test case

- Automatically run tests on commits


## Functionalities

- Add replacement function presets like "Wrap in tag" (templates with placeholders ?). Or add a "wrap with HTML" replacement option where users just need to provide opening tags (eg. <em><span style='font-size: 1.5em;'>).

- Make sure iframes are visited

- What to do with html entities ?

- Extension page instructions : "Just install the extension and go to the options page, you will receive further instructions there."

- First open options : tutorial

- When closing the options page, if anyValueModified, offer the user to save changes before (and if the answer is yes, save then close)

- Add syntax highlighting on change for the function textarea and the code example in the function help modal dialog : http://prismjs.com/

- Improve validateRule() from options.js
